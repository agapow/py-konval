To do & bugs
------------

XXX: name is not great

XXX: CustomValidator is poor name

TODO: unify naming scheme

TODO: how to handle negation

XXX: everything in the one namespace?

TODO: email, url, etc. validators

TODO: toRegex or ToRegexSub (for subpatterns) & regex transformations

------------

- Introduce validator dependencies (i.e. if V1 fails, skip V2)
- Add internet validators (as above)
- Rethink IsList to allow for non-canonical matching as well
- Rethink Konval process states to potentially allow for non-valid,
  partially processed values to be accessible.
- Add about 20 more validators I can think of
- Improve edge-case handling on many of the existing validators
- Allow for multiple values through 1 validator (add support in base class)
- Allow for overridable error messages for validator instances
- Potentially create 2 types of error messages, user friendly and developer friendly?
