~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial release

v0.3, 20121113
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Reworked internal exception handling
* Replaced the fxn module with the Konval class
* Removed redundant validators / converters (consolidated many)
* Removed WrappingValidator since as long as the supplied object is callable it works.
* Re-wrote many of the validators to deal better with TypeErrors, ValueErrors etc...
* Introduced duck-type style error handling in many places
* Changed order of operations to Validate -> Convert since Validate should always be against
  raw input, not converted input
* Wrote unittests for all validators as well as Konval service class
* Reworked the vocabval validators to be less 'smart', prefer granular API
  and clear usage guidelines over magical methods and syntactic sugar.
