## Todo - always something.

In general, the maturity of this library is directly correlated to the number of validators that it ships with.

The core abstractions are pretty solid and are probably not going to change that much.

Contributions are generally encouraged towards bug fixes and adding more use-case validators.

Please take care to put new validators into the META package filed under a domain specific module.

Ensure your validator does not fit nicely in an existing META module before creating a new one.

### Important
- Finish writing tests for ALL validators

### Cool
- Allow for overridable error messages for validator instances
